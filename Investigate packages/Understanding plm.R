  # - Keywords  
  #  - #set will be used for things that need to be set for your specific
  #       file structure to get the code to run. Things like data directories 
  #  - #fix will be used for things that need to be fixed 
  #  - #note I will use the tags #note for things I think are important
  
  
  
  # - purpose of code:
  # Get working exampels of the main funcitons in the "plm" Package 
  # This is a huge package with a lot of little helper functions as well as several test for various 
  # aspects of panel data. For now I am juts focusing in on the PLM function as a substitute for LM on fixed effects models 
  # can explor other aspects of this as project evolves 
  
  # -requirments to run 
  # all data necessary is from the package
